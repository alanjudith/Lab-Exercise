	<h1>CLASSICAL MUSIC!</h1>
	<p>
	Classical music is a genre of music that emerged in the late 17th century and reached its peak during the Classical period (approximately 1750-1820).<br> 
	It is known for its complexity, structural intricacy, and emphasis on instrumental compositions.<br> 
    Classical music is characterized by its use of formal structures, such as sonatas, symphonies, concertos, and operas.<br>  
	These compositions often follow specific patterns and adhere to established rules of harmony and counterpoint. The music is typically written down in musical notation, allowing for precise interpretation and performance.<br>
